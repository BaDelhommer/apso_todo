# apso_todo

#### Obligatory todo app

Built with Go version 1.22.2

Command line REPL to do app for no reason. I think there is a legal requirement that a person learning to code makes a to do app, so here is mine. I wanted something simple to track tasks as work, so I figured I would kill two birds with one stone.
